 * all the calls that make up an iteration over all the inode's paths.
 *
 * @dir_ino: The inode number of the directory containing the entry to
 * our inode to search from.  If this parent directory contains no more
 * entries to our inode then we'll search through other parent directory
 * inodes in inode order.
 *
 * @dir_pos: The position in the dir_ino parent directory of the entry
 * to our inode to search from.  If there is no entry at this position
 * then we'll search through other entry positions in increasing order.
 * If we exhaust the parent directory then we'll search through
 * additional parent directories in inode order.
 *
 * @result_ptr: A pointer to the buffer where the result struct and
 * absolute path will be stored.
 *
 * @result_bytes: The size of the buffer that will contain the result
 * struct and the null terminated absolute path name.
 *
 * To start iterating set the desired target inode, dir_ino to 0,
 * dir_pos to 0, and set result_ptr and _bytes to a sufficiently large
 * buffeer (sizeof(result) + PATH_MAX is a solid choice).
 *
 * After each returned result set the next search dir_ino and dir_pos to
 * the returned dir_ino and dir_pos.  Then increment the search dir_pos,
 * and if it wrapped to 0, increment dir_ino.
 *
 * This only walks back through full hard links.  None of the returned
 * paths will reflect symlinks to components in the path.
 *
 * This doesn't ensure that the caller has permissions to traverse the
 * returned paths to the inode.  It requires CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH which
 * bypasses permissions checking.
 *
 * This call is not serialized with any modification (create, rename,
 * unlink) of the path components.  It will return all the paths that
 * were stable both before and after the call.  It may or may not return
 * paths which are created or unlinked during the call.
 *
 * On success 0 is returned and result struct is filled with the next
 * absolute path.  The path_bytes length of the path includes a null
 * terminating byte.  dir_ino and dir_pos refer to the position of the
 * final component in its parent directory and can be advanced to search
 * for the next terminal entry whose path is then built by walking up
 * parent directories.
 *
 * ENOENT is returned when no paths are found.
 *
 * ENAMETOOLONG is returned when the result struct and path found
 * doesn't fit in the result buffer.
 *
 * Many other errnos indicate hard failure to find the next path.
